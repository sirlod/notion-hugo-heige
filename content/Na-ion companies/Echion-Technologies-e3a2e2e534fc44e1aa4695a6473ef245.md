Their main focus is Li-ion, but they also work with LiFUN on application in Na-ion.


Lithium-ion batteries designed with Echion XNO® anode materials achieve a unique combination of [high safety](https://echiontech.com/echion-topsoe-lnmo-xno/), extreme fast-charge and discharge capability, and [very long cycle-life](https://www.echiontech.com/news/ielectrolyte). We achieve this together with up to double (x2) the energy density of market leading LTO cells.


This unique performance envelope is ideal for high-power batteries electrifying heavy-duty commercial and industrial applications, a premium, fast-growing market driven by total cost of ownership.


Our XNO® materials are based on proprietary mixed niobium oxide compositions and microparticle designs protected by multiple international patent families, 6 of which have granted patents.

- Echion Technology is a British start-up founded in 2017 as a spin-off of Cambridge University. It develops unique materials for next-generation batteries, notably materials compatible with fast-charging.
