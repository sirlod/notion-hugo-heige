- Farad Power is an American company founded in 2012. It develops carbon materials for next-generation applications in energy storage.


Farad Power Inc. was founded to develop a new class of advanced carbon 
materials for energy storage devices with considerable functional 
improvements over the current generation of commercially available 
electrode materials for batteries and supercapacitors.
Furfuryl alcohol is our primary carbon pre-cursor and is extracted from 
plant-based biomass (agricultural waste). Specifically, hemicellulose (a
 heteropolymer mixture of several polymers like xylose, glucose, 
mannose, etc.) is a component of plant biomass from which the chemical 
furfural (C5H54O2) – also called furfuraldehyde – is extracted. We use furfuryl alcohol (C5H6O2)
 – produced by hydrogenation of furfural – as our starting point to make
 our carbons.
The basic process is straightforward and utilizes existing manufacturing
 infrastructure to synthesize the carbon composites.
The range of materials that have been synthesized using this technology 
include plain low surface-area hard carbons, carbon-silicon composites, 
pre-lithiated and pre-sodiated carbon-sulfur composites and plain and 
doped high surface area activated carbons.
